To start things off, I wanted to say that I had no background in ruby or object-oriented programming, like many of the people in the course.
When the project week started, even though I finished the labs we were working on, it was a typical situation where you have to learn how to do something, whereas, in the real world, the actual work is entirely different.
I had a lot to adapt to, which is good. But challenging.
At first, I went with the basics. I found an API, I didn’t know how to plan it out or structure it, so I just started. I had a simple get request, had one class invoked after the get request and holds the information that I wanted to pull from the API, and one type for the menu.
I also didn’t completely understand the point of the power of OO (Object Oriented) Programming, so quickly enough, step by step, I had my program working, but it was a GIANT mess, over 70 if, elsif statements, and quickly the menu class became the WHOLE program.
So, I went back and started working on it. I started changing things around, looking up Specific “how-to”s in google. And step by step, I managed to do something that I am proud of.
Yes, it’s simple to program, nothing crazy. These sleepless nights, constant frustration, and lack of ‘AHA’ Moments were just part of the process. I can’t say exactly when it all started to make sense, but in a swift moment, things just naturally fell in order, and I started UNDERSTANDING what I am doing. It felt great, it felt so good, it felt like Christmas arrived early, and it also made me realize that frustration process, it’s WHAT I want to learn, how to handle it, that perhaps is the most significant skill I can hope to master, in my journey as a software engineer.
