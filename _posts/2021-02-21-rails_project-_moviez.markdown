I recently finished my third project so far in Flatiron school,
Rails were as hard as it was easy because it comes with many built-in mechanics that help the developer, but to fully understand them, you have to dig in.
I built a simple movie database app utilizing a free API called OMDB, where you can sign up either the traditional (Email, name, password) or via Google(more modern, safe way).
The most challenging part wasn’t coding or even wasn’t the associations between models. The hardest, catchiest part of the whole project was understanding how much rails does for you.
I tried my best to make most parts of my code “the long way” to understand these parts completely. For example, a well-known gem called devise would create a whole user auth system for you with two clicks of a button, along with the HTML, table data, routes, and the auth itself.
But part of doing this project, for me at least, was the make sure I do my best to understand each piece of code I write because at the end of the day, the more you know, the more you can give back.
Sure, you can use devise, along with the scaffold command, and within 10 minutes, you have a fully functioning rails project running, but on the other hand, if you don’t fully grasp the idea, the smallest bug would drive you nuts,
Trust me. It doesn’t matter how well you code. You will always have some bugs.
I genuinely think it’s incredible how much can code “understand” and “predict/guess.” it’s something that I genuinely love about ruby on rails, and it’s one of the most aspiring things there for me in coding.
