I have so much to say about react and redux, both good and bad, I am not sure where to start.
Is redux amazing? Hell yeah, is it complicated until it sinks in? You bet!
Does react feels like the future of programming? Absolutely.

Since I was unsure where to start, I figured it is best to start with why redux was necessary for my project.
From the very first project, i was obsessed with user-based websites. I've done up to now probably over a dozen projects related to the user, I don't know why I feel like userless projects don't excite me, but that's the reality.

Of course, one of the biggest challenges with react-redux is sessions. How on earth do you keep users "logged in" with stateless language? Furthermore, even if you manage to integrate rails with sessions, how will you connect it with the front-end?
Especially with a language that re-renders constantly.

Well, after hours and days of mixed trial and error, I have come to find a way to do it.
I am sure there are better, more efficient ways, but the fact that I've managed to do it myself meant the world.

The ease of state-management that redux brings to react is perhaps one of the most challenging and rewarding aspects of my entire six months in flatiron.

Like everyone who starts a project, I have had these ideas to make a fantastic app. after getting the user interface done, I was almost out of time. However, I managed to get a basic version of what I wanted to achieve, and I will update and work on it until what I have imagined is reached. However, that will have to wait until after I finish the Bootcamp.
