I have finished the fourth project in my online Bootcamp. This project was very little backend. It focused on the front — end for the most part—a single-page web app.
I had to brainstorm quite a lot about what I want to do since, as a person, if I am not passionate about the project, I will not do my best, which quickly escalates to nothing good. At least, that is my perspective.
A few weeks ago, I needed to make a shopping list. I am sure we have all been there, one way or another, whether it's groceries, house essentials, etc.
I was filled with confusion as to, in case you didn't know, every store has similar products, but different quantities. For example, let's take "toilet paper," Almost every store, whether big or small, will carry it. But for the sake of this example, we will focus on big chains.
Target, Walmart, Amazon, and almost every big chain grocery store or any big chain, will carry that item, many will even carry the same product, but the prices are always different. one is a little cheaper, one is a little more expensive, one affects with an extra roll, the other with less, etc.
As a person, I am intrigued by the idea of finding the product I want for the lowest price there is, as to I believe anyone else. Unfortunately, building an app that will scout all big chains and analyze each product is impossible because big chains are brilliant and purposely carrying the same branded items with different quantities to avoid just that, but it leads me to my project idea. A price tracker. A tiny — basic one, but yet, a price tracker.
Although I wish I am happy I finished the project and did what I wanted, I genuinely want to have chosen a different project since implementing a user interface wasn't possible and made me do a long extensive, tedious workaround.
And even though many parts of my project are pretty hardcoded, the thrill of envisioning something and seeing it come to life — made my day.
